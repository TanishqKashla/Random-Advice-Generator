## API Details

The project utilizes the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice) to fetch random pieces of advice. 

- **Endpoint:** `https://api.adviceslip.com/advice`

## API Integration

This project uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) to make HTTP requests to the Advice Slip API. Hereâ€™s a snippet of how Axios is used to fetch the data:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const fetchAdvice = async () => {
    try {
        const response = await axios.get('https://api.adviceslip.com/advice');
        // Extracting advice and id from the API response
        const advice = response.data.slip.advice;
        const adviceNumber = response.data.slip.id;

        // Update the state or handle advice data
        getAdvice(advice);
        getAdviceNumber(adviceNumber);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching the advice:', error);
    }
};
```
